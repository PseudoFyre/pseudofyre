# James Morris — @PseudoFyre

Hi, I'm James—A 31 year old programmer from England. My past was heavily based around IRC. This is where I learned to manage servers and extend my programming knowledge.

In 2008, I met [Sketch](https://github.com/SketchNI) through an IRC Network named UKBlabberbox. This soon became my main focus for the next few years, 10 years is just a few, right? It went through many iterations and changes.

The past couple of years, I started out as a server admin for a content creator named [Kryllyk](https://www.youtube.com/kryllyk). While part of that team my duties included managing and maintaining his network of Minecraft servers working alongside the Community Manager and helping with various behinds the scenes stuff working on ways to expand, develop and diversify the community.

In July 2018, I moved on to a more senior role within the community of content creator [ChosenArchitect](https://www.youtube.com/chosenarchitect).

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. This tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklist are probably my absolute favourite. If you ever feel like I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain.
